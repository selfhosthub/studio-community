# Users Guide

Use Studio to build workflows, run them, and understand what happened when things go right (or wrong).

If you just want to *get something running*, start at **Your first workflow**.

---

## Common tasks

Most people come here to do one of these:

- **Build your first workflow** → [Your first workflow](#your-first-workflow)
- **Add an API key / credentials** → [Add provider credentials](#add-provider-credentials)
- **Trigger a workflow from the outside** → [Webhooks](#webhooks)
- **See why a run failed** → [Debug a failed run](#debug-a-failed-run)
- **Retry a failed step** → [Retry and rerun](#retry-and-rerun)
- **Find files created by a workflow** → [Files](#files)
- **Install a provider from the marketplace** → [Marketplace](#marketplace)

---

## Studio in one minute

Studio is built around a simple loop:

**Template → Workflow → Instance**

- **Template**: a reusable blueprint (often shared)
- **Workflow**: your configured version (steps + settings + credentials)
- **Instance**: one run of a workflow (results, logs, files, errors)

You don’t need to memorize this. You’ll feel it after your first run.

---

## Your first workflow

Goal: create something small, run it, and watch it finish.

### 1) Create a workflow

Go to **Workflows → Create New** (`/workflows/create`) and choose **From Scratch**.

Give it a name like **My First Workflow**.

### 2) Add one step

Open the editor (`/workflows/{id}/edit`) and click **+ Add Step**.

Pick:
- **Service type** (what kind of thing you want to do)
- **Provider** (who offers it)
- **Service** (the exact action)

**Tip:** start with the **Core** provider if you see it. Core steps are built-in and usually don’t require API keys.

### 3) Configure the step

Fill in the required fields (marked with `*`). Leave everything else alone for now.

### 4) Save and run

Click **Save Workflow**, then **Run**.

You’ll land on the instance view (`/instances/{id}`) where you can watch each step execute.

### What “good” looks like

- The instance moves through steps and finishes as **Completed**
- Each step shows a result payload (even if it’s small)

If you hit **No credentials configured**, that’s normal — it means you chose a provider that needs an API key. Next section.

---

## Add credentials and secrets

Studio has two related concepts:

- **Provider credentials**: “Log into this external service” (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
- **Secrets**: “Store this sensitive value and reuse it anywhere” (tokens, URLs, shared secrets)

Most workflow issues early on are just missing credentials.

### Add provider credentials

Use this when a step talks to a provider (OpenAI, Leonardo, Google Drive, etc.).

1. Go to **Secrets** (`/secrets`)
2. Open **Provider Credentials**
3. Choose the provider
4. Paste the required values (API key, client secret, etc.)
5. Save

Now go back to your workflow and run again.

**Common gotcha:** if you have multiple organizations, make sure you’re adding credentials in the right org.

### Create an organization secret

Use this when you want a reusable value (like `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SLACK_TOKEN`, or `MY_API_BASE_URL`).

1. Go to **Secrets** (`/secrets`)
2. Open **Organization Secrets**
3. Click **Create Secret**
4. Name it something clear (example: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`)
5. Save

### Use a secret inside a step

In a step configuration panel, look for places where you can provide a value via mapping.

Common patterns:
- A field lets you select **Secret** / **From secrets**
- Or you use **Input Mappings** and choose a value source

If you can’t find a secret picker yet, your step UI might only support raw values in that field today. In that case, store the value as a provider credential (preferred for provider auth) or as a secret for workflow config values.

### Rotate a key safely

When you rotate keys (recommended):
1. Create the new key in the external provider
2. Update it in Studio (credentials or secret)
3. Re-run a small test workflow
4. Only then revoke the old key

---

## Workflows

Workflows are where you build the automation.

### Where workflows live

- List: `/workflows/list`
- Create: `/workflows/create`
- Edit: `/workflows/{id}/edit`

### Save vs Save As

- **Save** updates the workflow you’re editing
- **Save As** makes a copy (best way to experiment without breaking a working workflow)

### Step modes: Enabled, Skip, Stop

Use these when you’re debugging:

- **Enabled**: runs normally
- **Skip**: bypass the step (data flows through)
- **Stop**: run up to this point, then stop

If your workflow fails halfway through, setting the failing step to **Skip** is often the quickest way to validate the rest of the flow.

---

## How workflows start

Workflows can start in several ways depending on how they're configured.

### Manual

Click **Run** in the workflow editor or from the instance list. The workflow starts immediately with no prompts.

### Form

If any step parameter is mapped to a form input, or if an AI agent prompt has variables, Studio shows a form before the workflow runs. You fill it out and click Submit (the button label may vary — e.g. "Create Video"). The workflow does not start until you submit the form. This is the same mechanism that powers the Experience View — the form is the trigger.

### Webhook

An external system sends an HTTP request to the workflow's webhook URL. No user action required. See [Webhooks](#webhooks) for setup details.

### Schedule

The workflow runs automatically on a time interval. No user action required. The workflow must be set to **Active** for schedule triggers to fire.

### API

The workflow is triggered programmatically via the Studio API. Useful for integrating Studio into your own applications or scripts.

### Event

The workflow runs when a specific event occurs in a connected app (e.g. a new record in Airtable, a form submission in another service). Configuration depends on the provider.

---

## Webhooks

Webhooks let something outside Studio start your workflow.

### Create or enable a webhook trigger

1. Open your workflow editor (`/workflows/{id}/edit`)
2. Set trigger type to **Webhook**
3. Copy the webhook URL
4. Configure the external service to POST to that URL

### Secure your webhook

If Studio shows a webhook **secret**, use it.

Typical security setups:
- **HMAC signature** (best)
- **Bearer token**
- **Secret query/header** (acceptable for internal use)

If you don’t secure the webhook, anyone who finds the URL can trigger it.

### When a webhook “does nothing”

Check:
- Is the workflow **Active**?
- Did the request reach Studio (you should see an instance created)?
- Is the webhook URL correct (no missing org slug)?
- Is authentication configured correctly (signature/token)?

---

## Mapping data between steps

This is how workflows become real automation: step outputs feed the next step.

### The idea

Step A produces output (like an image URL). Step B uses that output as input (upload the image).

### Where to map values

In the step configuration panel, find **Input Mappings** (or mapping controls next to fields).

Typical mapping sources:
- **Static value**: type it in
- **From previous step**: choose an output field
- **Form input**: ask the user at run time (if supported)

### Debug mapping problems

If a step fails with “invalid parameters”:
- Confirm required fields are mapped
- Confirm types match (string vs number vs object)
- Check the instance detail to see what the step actually received

---

## Templates

Templates are reusable workflow blueprints.

### Use a template

1. Go to Templates (`/templates/list` or `/templates/marketplace`)
2. Pick a template
3. Create a workflow from it
4. Add credentials as needed
5. Run it

### Publish your workflow as a template

If your org supports template publishing:
- Start from a working workflow
- Clean up step names and descriptions
- Replace hardcoded sensitive values with secrets/credentials
- Then publish

---

## Runs and results

Every time you click **Run**, Studio creates an **Instance**.

### Find your instances

- List: `/instances/list`
- Detail: `/instances/{id}`

### Read an instance like a debugger

When something fails:
1. Open the instance
2. Find the first red step/job
3. Open its error details
4. Check inputs (what the step received)
5. Check outputs from the previous step (what it produced)

### Debug a failed run

Most failures fall into a few buckets:

- **No credentials configured**
  - Add provider credentials under `/secrets`, then re-run

- **Credential expired or revoked** (e.g., OAuth token expired, API key rotated)
  - Go to **Secrets** (`/secrets`) → **Provider Credentials** and update or reauthorize the credential
  - Go back to the failed instance and rerun the failed step — no need to start a new run

- **Invalid parameters**
  - A required field is missing or the value type is wrong
  - Fix step config or mappings

- **Timeout**
  - External service is slow or unavailable
  - Try again; if it repeats, reduce workload or check provider status

- **Rate limit exceeded**
  - You hit a provider’s API limits
  - Wait, retry, or reduce concurrency (if your org/super admin configured it)

### Retry and rerun

You don't need to start a new run when something fails. You can fix the problem and pick up where you left off.

You'll typically see actions like:

- **Retry job**: reruns just the failed step
- **Rerun only**: reruns a step (even if completed)
- **Rerun and continue**: reruns a step and downstream steps

Use **Retry job** for flaky network/provider issues.
Use **Rerun and continue** after you change configuration or credentials.

### Recover from a credential failure

This is a common scenario: a step fails because an OAuth token expired or an API key was revoked.

1. Note which step failed and the error (usually an auth/credential error)
2. Go to **Secrets** (`/secrets`) → **Provider Credentials**
3. Find the provider and reauthorize (OAuth) or update the key
4. Go back to the failed instance
5. Click **Rerun** on the failed step

The step runs with the updated credential. All previous steps keep their results — nothing is lost or re-executed.

### Delete an instance

You can permanently delete instances you created to free up storage. Only finished instances (completed, failed, or cancelled) can be deleted.

1. Go to **Instances** (`/instances/list`)
2. Find the instance row
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm

**What gets removed:**
- All output files (images, video, audio, documents)
- All thumbnails
- All database records (steps, jobs, resources)
- The instance directory on disk

This is permanent and cannot be undone. If you need to keep any files, download them before deleting.

## Human-in-the-loop

Some workflows pause mid-run waiting for a human action before continuing.

### What you'll see

The instance will show a paused or waiting state. The instance detail page will display a prompt or decision UI — for example, an image selection, a text confirmation, or an approve/reject choice.

### What you need to do

Respond to the prompt to resume the workflow. If you don't respond, the workflow will remain paused until the timeout (if configured) or until you act.

### Patterns

There are two core human-in-the-loop patterns:

- **Approval** — the workflow pauses and asks you to approve or reject before it continues. Common for review gates (e.g. reviewing generated images before they're used in the next step).
- **Notify** — the workflow sends a notification that requires acknowledgment. You confirm you've seen it and the workflow moves on.

### Inside the Experience View

Human-in-the-loop steps also appear inside the Experience View as a "decisions" phase. You may see image pickers, confirmation prompts, or approval dialogs as part of an otherwise seamless experience.

### Troubleshooting

If a workflow seems stuck, check the instance detail for a pending human action before assuming it failed. A paused instance is waiting for you, not broken.

---

## Files

Workflows can generate or download files, and Studio keeps them in one place.

- Files page: `/files`

### What you can do there

- Browse by type (images, video, documents, etc.)
- Preview supported formats (image/video/audio/PDF)
- Download outputs from runs
- Delete files (careful: this is usually permanent)

### If files aren’t showing up

Check:
- Did the workflow step actually create/download a file?
- Did the instance complete that step successfully?
- Are you in the right organization?

---

## Marketplace

Marketplace is where you install providers and templates (if enabled in your deployment).

- Providers: `/providers/marketplace`
- Templates: `/templates/marketplace`

### Install a provider

1. Open provider marketplace
2. Click **Install**
3. Add credentials under `/secrets` if required
4. Use the provider’s services in the workflow editor

If a provider is "Advanced" or otherwise gated, your access depends on how your super admin configured tiers.

---

## Notifications

Notifications help you keep track of what changed and what failed.

- Notifications: `/notifications`

Typical categories:
- workflow events
- job/step failures
- system events
- security/billing (if enabled)

Use notifications for “what happened” and instances for “why it happened.”

---

## Quick reference

### Workflow statuses

- **Draft**: still building (often can run manually, but triggers may be off)
- **Active**: ready to run; triggers enabled
- **Inactive**: paused; won’t respond to triggers
- **Archived**: hidden/retained for records

### Instance statuses

- **PENDING**: created, waiting to execute
- **PROCESSING**: running now
- **WAITING_FOR_WEBHOOK**: paused for external callback
- **PAUSED**: manually paused
- **COMPLETED**: finished successfully
- **FAILED**: error occurred
- **CANCELLED**: stopped by user/system

### Keyboard shortcuts

Flow editor:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` undo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` redo
- `Delete/Backspace` delete selection
